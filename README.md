# Ostur - Cheese cave controller!

This is a work in progress for a cheese cave controller system.
The goal is to be able to control a mini fridge to get the right conditions for cheesemaking.

The project consists of:

* [Hardware](hw/2.0/) - A microcontroller and various temperature/humidity sensors
* [Firmware](fw/) - Code in the microcontroller to control the fridge and measure temperature/humidity values
* [Software](sw/2.0/) - Python scripts to communicate with the microcontroller to log and plot data

So far, it's been used to [makeBrie](https://imgur.com/a/cGHID) [successfully](https://imgur.com/B5qB1kU)!

Once it's more user friendly, I'll add usage instructions so others can reproduce the setup.
