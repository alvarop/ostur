# Ostur Hardware

To make some brie, there are 3 main components required:
1. An [Ostur controller](controller/) PCB
2. A controllable power outlet relay module. I'm using [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2935) from Adafruit
3. 2+ [Ostur temperature/humidity sensors](humidity/). One for the fridge temperature and the rest for each aging container (if any).

Optional components are:
1. [Silicon Labs BLED112](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=1446-1030-ND) USB dongle for receiving BLE beacon data of the temperature/humidity.
